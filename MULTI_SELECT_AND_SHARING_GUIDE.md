# Multi-Select and Sharing Feature Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of iPhone-style multi-select functionality for both Wishlist and Collection screens, along with a comprehensive item sharing system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Wishlist Item Editing ✅
**Component**: `EditWishlistItemModal.tsx`

Allows users to edit existing wishlist items with full field support:
- Item name, category, manufacturer, pattern
- Maximum price, description, eBay search terms
- Pre-populates all existing data
- Saves changes to database
- Integrated into wishlist details modal

**Usage**: Tap "Edit Item" button in wishlist item details

---

### 2. Multi-Select Mode (Both Screens) ✅

#### Activation
- **Long-press** any item card to activate selection mode
- Checkboxes appear on all items
- Search bar is replaced with selection bar
- Selected items show highlighted border

#### Visual Feedback
- Circular checkboxes (28px diameter)
- Unchecked: White background with gray border
- Checked: Colored background (green for collection, pink for wishlist)
- White checkmark icon when selected
- Border highlight on selected cards

#### Selection Bar
Replaces the search bar when active:
```
[Cancel] [X Selected] [Share] [Delete]
```

- **Cancel**: Exits selection mode, clears selection
- **Count**: Shows number of selected items
- **Share**: Opens native share sheet with URL
- **Delete**: Confirms and deletes selected items

---

### 3. Mass Delete Functionality ✅

**How it works**:
1. User selects multiple items
2. Taps delete icon (trash can)
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. Shows count: "Delete X items?"
5. User confirms or cancels
6. Deletes all selected items in single database call
7. Refreshes list automatically
8. Exits selection mode

**Database Operation**:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .delete()
  .in('id', Array.from(selectedItems));
```

---

### 4. Mass Share Functionality ✅

**How it works**:
1. User selects one or more items
2. Taps share icon
3. Creates `shared_collections` database record
4. Generates unique, secure share token
5. Opens native share sheet
6. User can share via any method (SMS, email, social, etc.)
7. Selection mode exits after sharing

**Share URL Format**:
```
https://yourapp.com/shared/[token]
```

**Database Record Created**:
```typescript
{
  user_id: string,
  collection_type: 'wishlist' | 'collection',
  item_ids: string[],
  share_token: string (auto-generated),
  expires_at: null,
  view_count: 0
}
```

---

### 5. Shared Collections Database ✅

**Table**: `shared_collections`

**Schema**:
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (references auth.users)
- share_token: TEXT (unique, auto-generated)
- collection_type: TEXT ('wishlist' or 'collection')
- item_ids: TEXT[] (array of item IDs)
- expires_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (nullable)
- view_count: INTEGER (default 0)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

**Security (RLS Policies)**:
- ✅ Users can create their own shares (authenticated)
- ✅ Users can view their own shares (authenticated)
- ✅ Users can update their own shares (authenticated)
- ✅ Users can delete their own shares (authenticated)
- ✅ **Anyone** can view shared items by token (including anonymous)
- ✅ Anyone can update view count (for tracking)

**Indexes**:
- `share_token` - Fast lookup by token
- `user_id` - List user's shares
- `created_at` - Order by date

---

### 6. Public Shared View Screen ✅

**Route**: `/shared/[token]`

**Features**:
- Beautiful grid display of shared items
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Owner information displayed (name, item count, view count)
- Item cards with images, names, prices, conditions
- Tap items to view full details modal
- Responsive design matching app aesthetic

**For Anonymous Users**:
- Prominent "Sign Up Free" CTA banner
- Full view access to shared items
- No ability to save or interact
- Encourages account creation

**For Authenticated Users**:
- Same beautiful view
- Future: "Add to My Wishlist" functionality
- Can create their own shares

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid token: 404 error with helpful message
- Expired share: 410 error explaining expiration
- Loading state with spinner
- Network errors handled gracefully

  [token]+api.ts               - API route for fetching shared data
```

  collection.tsx                - Added multi-select, share, delete
```

### Database
```
Supabase Migration: create_shared_collections

```

---

## Technical Details

### Selection State Management
```typescript
const [selectionMode, setSelectionMode] = useState(false);
const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

**Set** is used for O(1) add/remove operations and efficient has() checks.

### Long Press Detection
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() => handleItemPress(item)}
  onLongPress={() => handleLongPress(item.id)}
>
```

### Toggle Selection Logic
```typescript
const toggleItemSelection = (itemId: string) => {
  setSelectedItems(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    if (newSet.has(itemId)) {
      newSet.delete(itemId);
    } else {
      newSet.add(itemId);
    }
    // Auto-exit if no items selected
    if (newSet.size === 0) {
      setSelectionMode(false);
    }
    return newSet;
  });
};
```

### Share Token Generation
Tokens are automatically generated by PostgreSQL:
```sql
share_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT encode(gen_random_bytes(16), 'base64')
```

This creates a 22-character base64-encoded token that is:
- ✅ Cryptographically secure
- ✅ URL-safe
- ✅ Unique (database enforced)
- ✅ Unguessable

---

## Styling

### Selection Overlay (Checkbox)
```typescript
selectionOverlay: {
  position: 'absolute',
  top: 8-12, // Varies by screen
  right: 8-12,
  zIndex: 10,
}

checkbox: {
  width: 28,
  height: 28,
  borderRadius: 14,
  borderWidth: 2,
  borderColor: '#cbd5e0',
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
}

checkboxSelected: {
  backgroundColor: '#38a169' | '#db2777', // Green or pink
  borderColor: '#38a169' | '#db2777',
}
```

### Selection Bar
```typescript
selectionBar: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  paddingHorizontal: 16,
  paddingVertical: 12,
  borderBottomWidth: 1,
  borderBottomColor: '#e2e8f0',
}
```

### Card Selection Highlight
```typescript
cardSelected: {
  borderWidth: 2,
  borderColor: '#38a169' | '#db2777',
}
```

---

## Environment Configuration

Add to `.env`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

This is used to generate full share URLs. For local development:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Selection
- Using `Set` for O(1) operations
- Single database call for mass delete
- Optimistic UI updates

### Database Queries
- Indexed token lookups
- Batch item fetching with `in()`
- View count updated asynchronously

### Rendering
- FlatList for efficient scrolling
- Memoized item renders (implicit)
- Lazy image loading

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Select All / Deselect All** buttons
2. **Share with specific users** (private shares)
3. **Expiration date picker** for shares
4. **Share analytics** (views over time)
5. **Share templates** (pre-configured groups)
6. **"Add to Wishlist"** from shared views
7. **Copy link** button (without share sheet)
8. **QR code generation** for shares
9. **Share history** page for users
10. **Notifications** when shares are viewed

### Possible Improvements
1. Haptic feedback on selection (mobile)
2. Animated checkbox transitions
3. Swipe to select range
4. Share expiration reminder
5. Batch edit for selected items
6. Export selected items (CSV, PDF)

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Q: Selection mode won't activate**
A: Ensure `onLongPress` prop is on TouchableOpacity, not just View

**Q: Checkboxes not visible**
A: Check z-index and position: absolute on selectionOverlay

**Q: Share creates record but doesn't open sheet**
A: Check native Share.share() is properly awaited

**Q: Shared URL returns 404**
A: Verify token is being passed correctly in URL params

**Q: Anonymous users can't view shared items**
A: Check RLS policy allows anon access to shared_collections

### Debugging

Enable database query logging:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('shared_collections')
  .select('*')
  .eq('share_token', token);

console.log('Query result:', { data, error });
```

Check RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'shared_collections';
```
