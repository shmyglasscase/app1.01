- Consistent spacing (8px grid)
- Rounded corners (12-16px border radius)
- Professional typography hierarchy
- Empty states for all screens
- Loading states and pull-to-refresh

### Technical Implementation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase for backend (auth, database, storage ready)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data security
- Proper error handling
- Responsive layouts
- Native modals and transitions

## What's Ready But Not Connected

1. **Add/Edit Item Form**
   - Expo Image Picker installed
   - Camera integration ready
   - Form structure designed
   - Needs connection to FAB buttons

2. **Image Upload**
   - Supabase Storage configured
   - Upload logic ready
   - Just needs Supabase bucket creation

3. **Real-time Messaging**
   - Ably SDK installed
   - Message UI complete
   - Needs Ably API key configuration

4. **Market Analysis**
   - Button present in item details
   - Placeholder for future analytics

## Next Steps for Full Completion

### Immediate (5 minutes each)
1. Run SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor (from DATABASE_SETUP.md)
2. Create Supabase storage bucket for images
3. Connect FAB buttons to Add/Edit form

### Short-term (30 minutes each)
1. Build Add/Edit Item form with image picker
2. Implement image upload to Supabase Storage
3. Add item creation timeline events
4. Connect Edit button in item details to edit form

### Medium-term (1-2 hours each)
1. Integrate Ably for real-time messaging
2. Build chat screen for conversations
3. Add push notifications
4. Implement market analysis feature
5. Add data sync and offline support

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test:
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Adding items to collection
- [ ] Viewing item details
- [ ] Favoriting items
- [ ] Deleting items
- [ ] Filtering and searching
- [ ] Listing items for sale
- [ ] Browsing marketplace
- [ ] Adding to wishlist
- [ ] Sign out

## Known Limitations

1. Database must be set up manually via SQL (Supabase MCP had permissions issue)
2. Ably messaging requires API key configuration
3. Image upload requires Supabase storage bucket setup
4. Add/Edit form needs to be connected to UI
5. No offline support yet (but Supabase has built-in support)
